This is a project I made learning React from the official documentation [Here](https://es.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#storing-a-history-of-moves "Here") I really enjoyed and learnt making this.

**About the game:**
-The games is designed for two players, where one player is the 'X' and the other is the 'O'.
-The winner will be the player who gets three consecutives 'X's or 'O's in a row or in a column or in diagonal, this will end the game with a winner.
